        <div><h5>About Maxi Taxi Perth</h5></div>
        <div className='part1'><p>Maxi Taxi Perth is a taxi company in Perth providing premium customer service at standard taxi rates. We are not a dispatch 
                company but a group of highly experienced, individual taxi drivers based all across the Greater Perth area, united in our goal 
                of providing an excellent taxi service at all times, without charging extra for that service. At Maxi Taxi Perth, we go above
                and beyond to ensure our customers are satisfied. We treat all our passengers with the utmost respect and make them feel special.
                In a way, we provide limousine services – like having your very own chauffeur – yet we only
                charge standard taxi fares. What’s more, we offer unique services that regular taxi companies don’t provide,
                and we don’t charge anything extra for those services.</p>
